The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, as the acting Chief Data Strategist for the company guidance and decisions are data-backed to exploit new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Objective: 
    Build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, create three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

Tools used:

* Python Pandas Library and the 
* Jupyter Notebook.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

Plot designed considerations:
* Must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* Must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.
* Must stick to the Pyber color scheme (Gold, Light Sky Blue, and Light Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.
